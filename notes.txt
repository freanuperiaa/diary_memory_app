This project is going to serve as a Memory Trainer in form of a Diary Web App.

Every evening, a user shall write to the Diary
then every morning, the user should be shown his diary entries in the last
five days.

main page - link/button to write about his day
timeline - shows the diary entries within the last five days
archive - this is where the user can see all the records by years/months/days

!!!!!!!!!!!!
note that at the beginning, the records are just plain text
    -- but it will be improved step by step
!!!!!!!!!!!!


For me, I think a user should also have a profile page
    - it should show the number of entries he has written
    - it should show his progress in memory?
    - show info about self lol (something like 'About me')

-Create a User Model (done!)
    - should have the basics such as age, gender, etc.
    - should have the things related to the goal of the Diary App (to improve memory)
        .something like "confidence in my memory"
                        "about me" etc


APP CONTENTS!!!

- home page
        - should be something like, "welcome, {{user.first_name}}!"
                                    " you have {{num}} number of entries"
                                    "date today is blah"
                                    "click here to add entry"
        - if not logged in, should have "you are not logged in. click here to log in"

- Add diary entry   
        - usual django-crispy-forms form
        - should only be accessed by authenticated users

- timeline
        - ListView of the last five diary entries of the user
                - every entry should be shown in detail

- Archive
        - ListView of all the diary entries of the user.
         (should also have filter by category, this ill learn yet)

- My Profile
        - has info of the user. should also have the number of posts



Freanu's notes:
1.) Sir, I think you'll notice that in the views.py file, it looks very messy 
        I did my best in order for it to work, it's all a result of googling
        things and trying to fix things by my own logic. This is all caused by
        the manytomanyfield that I included in the model. I'm sure that it's 
        kind of wrong and that there's a better way for it to be done; I hope 
        that you'll guide me on this.
